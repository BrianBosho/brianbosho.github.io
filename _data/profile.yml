  <p>
    I am a Research Associate at Carnegie Mellon University Africa, working with <a href="https://www.africa.engineering.cmu.edu/about/contact/directory/bios/barros-joao.html" target="_blank">Prof. João Barros</a>, where my research is focused on creating data-efficient AI systems for real-world, low-resource environments.
  </p>
  <p>
    My interest lies in bridging the gap between advanced theory and deployable systems that solve tangible problems. Previously, I was a research intern in the <a href="https://xulabs.github.io/" target="_blank">Xulab</a> with Prof. Min Xu, where I applied 3D computer vision to accelerate discovery in computational biology (Cryo-ET). This experience, along with my work on LLM-powered robotics and federated learning, informs my current focus on vision foundation models and generative AI.
  </p>
  <p>
    My journey into AI has been shaped by a deep-seated drive to use technology to create local solutions for global challenges. I am actively seeking a PhD or research-scientist role to continue tackling fundamental research problems and to collaborate on building systems that can create a meaningful impact on human welfare.
