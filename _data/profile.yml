    Research Associate at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/africa/" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University Africa</a> 
    (M.S. Engineering AI, 2025) working at the intersection of geometry-aware computer vision and efficient learning. 
    My work spans diffusion-based visual data mining for low-resource urban traffic scenes, communication-efficient 
    federated graph neural networks (FedProp), LLM-guided robotic planning (RoboCRAM), and 3D cryo-electron tomography segmentation.

  <p>
    I aim to pursue a PhD in computer vision to advance robust 3D perception, depth/motion estimation, and scene reconstruction 
    in real-world environments.
