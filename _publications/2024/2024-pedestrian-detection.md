## Introduction

The single most important challenge for autonomous vehicle technology is ensuring the safety of vulnerable road users, particularly pedestrians. A vehicle's ability to reliably detect a person, estimate their distance, and predict their trajectory is fundamental to safe operation. This project addresses the first two components of this challenge by developing and integrating a robust computer vision system designed specifically for real-time pedestrian detection and distance estimation from a single camera feed.

</div>

Our system employs a two-pronged approach, combining a state-of-the-art object detection model with a powerful monocular depth estimation model to create a comprehensive perception tool.

## System Architecture and Methodology

The pipeline was designed to be both accurate and computationally efficient, making it suitable for real-world automotive applications. It consists of two main modules working in sequence.

### 1. Pedestrian Detection with YOLOv5

For the task of reliably identifying pedestrians in complex urban scenes, we selected the **YOLOv5** (You Only Look Once v5) architecture. YOLO is renowned for its excellent balance of speed and accuracy, making it an industry standard for real-time object detection.

    <div class="figure-caption">Figure 2: YOLOv5 pedestrian detection in various urban scenarios</div>
</div>

To specialize the model for our specific use case, we fine-tuned the pre-trained YOLOv5 model on the **CityPersons dataset**. This dataset is composed of thousands of images captured from a vehicle's perspective in various urban environments, providing a rich source of examples for training a robust pedestrian detector. This fine-tuning process allowed the model to learn the specific visual characteristics of pedestrians in diverse settings, including variations in lighting, partial occlusions, and different postures.

### 2. Monocular Depth Estimation with MiDaS

After identifying a pedestrian, the next critical step is to determine their distance from the vehicle. Traditional methods require stereo cameras or LiDAR, which can be expensive and complex. Our system overcomes this by using **MiDaS** (Multiple Depth Estimation Network via Splitting), a state-of-the-art model for monocular depth estimation.

    <img src="/assets/images/pedestrian-detection/depth-estimation.png" alt="Depth Estimation Results" class="img-fluid">
    <div class="figure-caption">Figure 3: MiDaS monocular depth estimation applied to detected pedestrians</div>
</div>

MiDaS is capable of inferring the depth of each pixel in an image from a single 2D input. Once our YOLOv5 model draws a bounding box around a detected pedestrian, we pass this region to the MiDaS model. The system then calculates the average depth value of the pixels within that bounding box to produce a reliable estimate of the pedestrian's distance from the camera.

## Technical Implementation

### Model Configuration

| Component | Architecture | Purpose |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Detection** | YOLOv5s | Real-time pedestrian identification |
| **Depth Estimation** | MiDaS v2.1 | Monocular distance calculation |

### Detection Performance

The system achieved strong performance metrics:

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Precision** | 0.816 | 81.6% of detected pedestrians were correct |
| **Recall** | 0.538 | 53.8% of actual pedestrians were detected |
| **F1-Score** | 0.647 | Balanced performance measure |
| **mAP@0.5** | 0.724 | Mean Average Precision at IoU threshold 0.5 |

### Key Performance Insights

**Precision (81.6%)**: When the model predicted a pedestrian, it was correct over 81% of the time, highlighting a low rate of false positives. This is crucial for automotive applications where false alarms can lead to unnecessary emergency braking.

**Recall (53.8%)**: The model successfully identified over half of all actual pedestrians in the test scenes. While there's room for improvement, this performance provides a solid foundation for safety-critical applications.

### Depth Estimation Accuracy

| Distance Range | Mean Error | Applications |
|----------------|------------|--------------|
| **0-10m** | ±0.8m | Critical safety zone |
| **10-25m** | ±1.2m | Planning horizon |
| **25m+** | ±2.1m | Early warning system |
