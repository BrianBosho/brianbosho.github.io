## Introduction

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven indispensable for analyzing relational data, but their reliance on centralized data clashes with the growing need for privacy. While Federated Learning (FL) offers a path forward, it encounters a fundamental obstacle with graph structures: the "missing neighbor problem." When a graph is partitioned across multiple clients, the connections between them are severed, disrupting the core message-passing mechanism that GNNs depend on.

This paper details FedProp, a novel framework that resolves this challenge. Unlike prior methods that rely on costly communication or complex generative models, FedProp introduces a communication-free, mathematically-grounded method for local feature reconstruction.

## Methodology: Reconstructing Features via Dirichlet Energy Minimization

At the heart of FedProp is a shift in perspective: we treat missing neighbor features not as a networking issue, but as a feature imputation problem that can be solved locally. The goal is to "fill in the blanks" for missing external neighbors in a principled way before the GNN model even begins its training.

### The Intuition: Graph Smoothness and Dirichlet Energy

How can we intelligently guess the features of a missing node? We rely on the principle of homophily, or the idea that "birds of a feather flock together." On a graph, this means a node's features are likely to be similar to those of its neighbors. We can quantify this "smoothness" using a concept from spectral graph theory: Dirichlet energy.

Imagine the feature values across a graph as a heat map. A low Dirichlet energy corresponds to a smooth distribution of heat, where adjacent nodes have similar temperatures. A high energy implies sharp, jagged differences between neighbors. Our objective is to impute the missing features such that they create the smoothest possible local graph—that is, they minimize the Dirichlet energy.

### The Mathematical Formulation

This intuition is formalized by minimizing the graph's Dirichlet residual. For each client's local subgraph, we solve the following optimization problem:

```
min ||X_L' - (D_LL)^-1 * L_LI * X_I||²
```

Where `X_L'` are the imputed features, `X_I` are the known internal features, and `L` represents the graph Laplacian. This equation essentially finds the imputed feature values that are most consistent with the existing local graph structure.

This optimization is solved using an efficient, power-iteration-like method that is guaranteed to converge. The entire process is self-contained on each client's device, requiring no external information. This leads to FedProp's most significant advantages:

- **Model-Agnostic**: The feature reconstruction is a pre-processing step, making FedProp compatible with any standard GNN architecture (GCN, GAT, etc.).
- **Zero Additional Communication**: As the imputation is entirely local, it avoids the privacy risks and communication bottlenecks of other federated GNN methods.

## Experimental Results

We conducted a rigorous empirical evaluation of FedProp to validate its performance against established baselines.

### Experimental Setup

**Datasets**: We used three standard academic benchmark datasets: Cora, Citeseer, and PubMed.

**Baselines**: FedProp was compared against leading federated GNN methods, including FedGCN and GCFL, as well as an idealized Centralized model with full data access.

**Data Distribution**: To simulate real-world conditions, we tested under both IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) and more challenging non-IID data partitions.

### Results

FedProp consistently demonstrated superior accuracy and efficiency. On the Cora dataset, FedProp achieved 80.8% accuracy, a 17% improvement over federated baselines and reached 99.6% of the performance of the fully centralized model.

| Dataset  | FedProp | FedGCN | GCFL | Centralized |
|----------|---------|--------|------|-------------|
| Cora     | 80.8%   | 68.9%  | 71.2% | 81.1%      |
| Citeseer | 75.3%   | 65.1%  | 67.8% | 75.9%      |
| PubMed   | 83.2%   | 76.4%  | 78.9% | 83.7%      |

Furthermore, the computational cost of the FedProp feature propagation step was negligible, consistently consuming less than 1% of overall training time. The process converged rapidly, typically within 30-40 iterations.

## Conclusion

The FedProp framework offers an effective and efficient solution to a core problem in federated graph learning. By reframing the missing neighbor challenge as a local feature imputation problem solved through Dirichlet energy minimization, it eliminates the need for extra communication and provides a versatile, high-performance tool for training GNNs on decentralized, privacy-sensitive data.
